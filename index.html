        <P>
          I graduated from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa with a BA in
          English and minors in Political Science and Spanish. I completed the
          Georgia Teacher Alternative Preparation Program with Metro RESA. In
          Georgia, I am certified to teach grades P-12 in English Language Arts.
          I am currently continuing my education with Vanderbilt University's
          Boot Camp for Full Stack Web Development.

          Working with Discovery Education, I assisted school districts with
          assessing the learning of their students in preparation for state
          standardized testing and implementation of Common Core Standards. As a
          School Researcher for Understanding Teaching Quality Research Study, I
          have experience evaluating teaching using several different assessment
          tool rubrics. I observed Reading and Math teachers and watched over
          600 videos of recorded class sessions. I also had an opportunity to
          find video exemplars of teachers demonstrating the Common Core
          Standards for the Measuring Effective Teaching project for The Gates
          Foundation.
