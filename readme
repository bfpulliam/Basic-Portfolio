#Overview

In this assignment, I built a basic professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS in accordance with a style guide and template to replace a layout.

This is my first homework assignment as a web designer which focused on the front end segment of design.

##Design Requirements for Homework listed below:

###Recommended Assignment - That Portfolio Though
IMPORTANT Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots. You'll find the specs for these designs below.
The content for the index.html should be unique to you.

Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.

After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the style.css file you created.

Additional Specifcations

Bonus
Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them.
